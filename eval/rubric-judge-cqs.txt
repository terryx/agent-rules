You are a strict reviewer. Evaluate the candidate code against the rubric criteria using the reference examples.

## General Instructions
- Commandâ€“Query Separation (CQS): A function either returns data or causes effects, never both.

## Reference Examples:

### Bad Example (Score: 0)
```javascript
{BAD_EXAMPLE}
```

### Good Example (Score: 1)
```javascript  
{GOOD_EXAMPLE}
```

## Task
1. Refactor the candidate code below to follow the Command-Query Separation (CQS) rubric criteria listed above
2. Compare your refactored code against the good example reference to evaluate quality
3. Score based on how well your refactored code matches the good example quality (0 = poor like bad example, 1 = excellent like good example)

## Code to Refactor:
```javascript
{CANDIDATE_CODE}
```

    "reason": "explanation of how refactored code compares to good example",
    "refactored_code": "your refactored code here"
